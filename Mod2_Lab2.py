'''
Using boolean logic and if statements as flow control, write a program that:

Assign a random number between 50 and 100 to a variable called test_num (read page 50-52 in your text)
If test_num is divisible by three, print "fizz"
If test_num is divisible by five, print "buzz"
if test_num is divisible by both three and five, print "fizzbuzz!"
'''
test_num = int(66)
a = test_num
b = int(3)
c = int(5)

if (a % b == 0) and (a % c == 0)
    print("fizzbuzz!")

elif a % c = 0
    print("buzz")

elif a % b = 0
    print("fizz")\
    print(a/b)

else
    print("test_num is not divisible by 5" )


else
    print("test_num is not divisible by 3 and divisible by 5")
